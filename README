Parts_JS

The parts library is meant to be completely modular in design. The core
of the library is extremely small but easy to build upon.

At the moment the library only provides a mechanism for including a selector
library, and mixins to extend the library.

p()
The selector is the default function. It gets the ball rolling by wrapping an
object in a chainable function. This can be an array of DOM objects, but it 
could just as easily be a string or array that you want your functions to 
operate upon.

p.value
This is the current wrapped object. Usually an array of DOM elements.

p.mixin()
The mixin function is the mechanism for adding functions to the library. The
mixin functions are called with the current object as the first argument and
any user supplied argument as the second. Mixin functions generally do not 
return any values but may modify p.obj or call other functions when they run.
If they do return a value, they break the chain and the value is passed to the
caller. An obvious example would be a toString function, which should just 
return a string.

sel()
sel is the barebones selector library included. At the moment it only supports
class, id, tag name and child selectors. Some examples of what's currently
supported:
p("#id")
p(".class")
p("body")
p("li #id")
But NOT p("div.class") yet...

If this is too restrictive, i've included a version parts_sizzle.js which supports
all the css selectors you could imagine.
 
To start, clone the repo and open index.html for a basic demo.

That's about it for now. Because this is extremely alpha software, use caution and
please provide feedback!
